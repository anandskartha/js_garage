            <p>I am a web developer based in Toronto, ON - Canada with immense experience in various Javascript technologies. With more than nine years of experience in the industry, I analyze customer requirements and user stories to every minute detail and create robust applications as per the client demands. I love my job. The learning opportunity I get from the projects I work on is immense. Each and every assignment gives me something to take on, makes me better in one way or the other, and the best part is that I can improve myself by making my client's business better.</p>
            <p>I have extensive experience in object oriented and functional Javascript, TypeScript, module bundling, workflow automation and unit testing. I also have profound experience in Javascript front end framework technologies like React/Redux, AngularJS and JQuery. Server-side JS technologies like Node, MongoDB and Redis is not strange to me. I have been a follower of Git all the time, and also, has good experience with TortoiseSVN and Mercurial. Visual Studio Code is my favorite text editor, but I work well with Sublime and Webstorm too. I debug using developer tools in all browsers, even though Google Chrome is my primary choice.</p>
            <p>Along with these experiences, I also have deep knowledge in Containerization using Docker, Cloud development using AWS and setting up and working with a basic CI/CD.</p>
            <p>Below are a few of the technologies that I have been working on. The star rating denotes the proficiency I have for each of the items. You may also go through my detailed career timeline after that. I hope this page will give you an idea of my skills and expertize.</p>
