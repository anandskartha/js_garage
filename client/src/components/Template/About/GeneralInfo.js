            <p>I am a web developer based in Bangalore with immense experience in various Javascript technologies. With more than eight years of experience in the industry, I analyze customer requirements and user stories to every minute detail and create robust applications as per the client demands. I love my job. And the learning opportunity I get from the projects I work on is immense. Each and every project gives me something to take on, makes me better in some way, and the best part is that I can improve myself by easing the life of my clients.</p>
            <p>I have extensive experience in object oriented and functional Javascript with strong hands-on knowledge on ECMAScript 5, ECMAScript 6+, module bundling, work flow automation and unit testing. I also have great experience in Javascript framework technologies like React, Angular 1, Jquery and server-side techs like Node.js, MongoDB and Redis. I have been a follower of Git all the time, and also, has good experience with TortoiseSVN and Mercurial. Visual Studio Code is my favorite text editor, but I work good with Sublime and Webstorm too. I debug using developer tools in all browsers, even though chrome is my primary choice.</p>
